  # Please read chapter 3 of Free Culture. Write a short paragraph (8 to 10 sentences) of what you got out of reading that chapter.
     In chapter 3 of Free Culture, the author revealed a story between Jesse and RIAA. Jesse was a student in RPI, he was working on a search engine that was available on the RPI network. He modified and improved the engines that others had built. Later, he was sued by RIAA because RIAA claimed that Jesse violated copyright law. Due to the financial circumstance that Jesse was in, Jesse had to pay RIAA $15 million instead of fighting a lawsuit against them. This story shows the disadvantage of not using open-source software. If the search engine was open-source software, Jesse would have the right to modify and improve it without violating the copyright law. Furthermore, this story portrayed the importance of having open-source software, open-source software enable people to make things better without worrying about violating copyrights.

# Reflection:
An open-source project that interests me is YACS.N. For this lab report, I looked back at the stuff I did in YACS.N team. I was in RCOS class last semester, I joined YACS.N team and had an opportunity to coorporate with other students to develop new pathway features. The YACS.N is similar to Quacs, it can be updated if students come up with new idea about how to improving the website. The experience with YACS.N team is wonderful. I had learned new languages - Vue and json through the time I worked with other team members in pathway group.
