  # Please read chapter 3 of Free Culture. Write a short paragraph (8 to 10 sentences) of what you got out of reading that chapter.
      In chapter 3 of Free Culture, the author revealed a story between Jesse and RIAA. Jesse was a student in RPI, he was working on a search engine that 
      was available on the RPI network. He modified and improved the engines that others had built. Later, he was sued by RIAA because RIAA claimed that 
      Jesse violated the copyright law. Due to the financial circumstance that Jesse was in, Jesse had to pay RIAA $15 million instead of fighting a 
      lawsuit against them. This story shows the disadvantage of not using a open source software. If the search engine was an open source software, Jesse 
      would have the right to modify and improve it without violating the copyright law. Furthermore, this story portrayed the importance of having open 
      source software,open source software enable people to make things better without worrying about violating copyrights.
