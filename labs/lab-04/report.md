# Step 3:
It's important to choose a LICENSE because the LICENSE allows other people to use your work as an open-source, and give you credit for the original work. 
More importantly,there are various types of license, license will specify the restrictions on your project. You should choose the license that fits your need 
carefully. For example, if you don't want your project to be free software, you should use the license that specify the restriction that you want to make.

# Step 4:
It's important that you shouldn't choose a project that doesn't have a explicit license because you may get sued by violating the copyright of the project.
The owner of the project may not consider his/her project as an open-source project. They didn't explicitly give you the permission to use the project, which
means if you use it, they have the right to sue you.

# Step 5:
I agree with this claim because Gopher project is not open source project, it has more restriction than the open source project,
there are less people can contribute the project which means the project will have less developer. With less developers, Gopher project is lack of mind
share, it definitely is a big disadvantage to a project.

# Step 6:
Linux uses GPL v2 license due to its history, goals and philosophy. For Linux's history, the precursor in Linux history is GNU project, GNU project is 
a free software project, it can be reused in other computer programs. Also, the goal of the Linux system is to create fully functional and free operating system, 
the GPL license is for free software. For the philosphy of Linux, the creator of Linux want to make a operating system that is "free", "freak", and "x" 
(as an allusion to Unix). The GPL license is free software license, therefore, Linux is using it today.
