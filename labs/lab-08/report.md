# Checkpoint 2:
Question 2:
1. Find the Nightly and Experimental sections and look at some of the submissions. How can you see what tests were run for a particular submission? \
  You can click the build name of a specific site, and go to the "Test section" on that page, then click "View Tests Summary". Alternatively, you can click on the numbers for each section under "Test" to see what tests had not run, failed, or passed.

2. Find a submission with errors. Can you see what the error condition was? How does this help you debug the failure? \
  The submission that I choose is "svartalfheim". There are 4 build errors for that submission. I can error condition when I clicked on the number under the error section. The error condition help me debug because it shows what's the problem of a specific line in the code.

3. Find a system that is close to your specific configuration in the Nightly, Nightly Expected or one of the Masters sections. How clean is the dashboard? Are there any errors that you need to be concerned with? \
   The system that is close to my specific configuration in Nightly Expected is Mac11.x-AppleClang-dbg. It doesn't have any warning, erros, and it passed all tests.
